This program gives you an escape path from a given starting point in a maze (a square 2D array of int).
Each input file should have a line at the top of the file that has the square dimension of the matrix followed by the drop in point. 
The drop in point is the row/col pair indicating where you are dropped into the swamp. 
You escape the swamp by taking one step at a time to any adjacent square that is a 1 (a free space). 
You are not allowed to step on a zero cell (represents a wall).
